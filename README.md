## 🏢 Project Overview
This project involved designing and presenting a complete network infrastructure for a fictional startup company, Alchemy Mobile Apps (a small Android app and animation development business with 5–8 employees).

The goal was to create a secure, efficient, and scalable office network within a $15,000 budget, meeting both technical and business needs while considering building and leasing restrictions.

This assignment was originally given as a group project, but due to unexpected occurrences, it was finished individually.
